**Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning ( Confusion Matrix and Classification Metrics ) **

This project implements a Decision Tree-based classifier to predict whether an employee's salary is above or below $50K/year, using demographic and employment features like age, education level, and working hours. The solution includes:  
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding categorical features)  
- Model training & evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- Visualization (heatmaps, classification metrics)  
- Sample predictions in a structured table  

**Key Features:  **
✔ Clean, well-documented Python code  
✔ Jupyter Notebook for interactive testing  
✔ Visualizations for model performance  
✔ Easy-to-replicate workflow
